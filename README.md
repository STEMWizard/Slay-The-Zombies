# Slay-The-Zombies
Discontinued 2D top down shooter game made in Unity game engine for android devices. The latest source code for this project has been lost due to data loss so the code in this repository is outdated, however the screenshots below show the latest version. This project was a huge learning opportunity for me and caused me to improve drastically as a developer.
Check releases for most recent version.
